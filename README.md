## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This type of project usually involves:

Image Processing: Analyzing the screenshot to detect elements like buttons, text, images, and layout structures.
Machine Learning (Optional): Using a model (like a neural network) to classify and generate HTML/CSS based on what it recognizes in the image.
Front-End Code Generation: Translating the detected elements into structured HTML and styled CSS.

This project is designed to convert UI screenshots into HTML/CSS code. It uses image recognition and machine learning to identify the various elements
of a user interface and generates clean, responsive code.but the code failed... your welcome to clone the repo and play with it or edit it.
